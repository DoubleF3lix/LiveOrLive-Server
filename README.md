# Live or Live Server
A crummy clone of Buckshot Roulette, but multiplayer (get the client [here](https://github.com/DoubleF3lix/LiveOrLive-Client))

Just run `Main.cs` to start (on port 8080 by default). It can also be deployed on fly.io for free (config files are included), then the client just needs to be configured to connect to that new URL.
